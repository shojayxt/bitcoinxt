Bitcoin XT
==========

Bitcoin XT is an implementation of a Bitcoin full node that embraces Bitcoin's original vision of simple, reliable, low-cost transactions for everyone in the world. Bitcoin XT originated as a series of patches on top of Bitcoin Core and is now a independently maintained software fork. See our notable [features](https://bitcoinxt.software/patches.html).

XT uses the same data directories as Core so you can easily switch back and forth. You will keep and continue updating the same block chain.
 
Bitcoin XT downloads are code signed and are [built reproducibly using gitian](https://github.com/bitcoinxt/gitian.sigs). If you use it please [sign up to the announcement mailing list](https://bitcoinxt.software) so you can be reminded of new versions.

Development process
===================

To propose a patch for inclusion or to discuss Bitcoin development in general, you are welcome to use the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bitcoin-xt/).

We have a manifesto that lays out things we believe are important, which you can read about here:

Possible future features
========================

Ideas for useful protocol upgrades are tracked in the issue tracker.

Bitcoin XT is intended to be compatible with crowd funded development. If you would like to experiment with a (non consensus changing) protocol upgrade, please discuss it on the mailing list first. You should be able to get a clear decision on the concept and design before starting on the implementation.
